Watch Progress Tracking
The player can send watch progress events to the parent window. You can save this progress to localStorage or your own backend. Here's a complete example:

Progress Tracking Script
// Add this script to your website
window.addEventListener("message", function (event) {
  // console.log("event: ", event);
  console.log("Message received from the player: ", JSON.parse(event.data)); // Message received from player
  if (typeof event.data === "string") {
    var messageArea = document.querySelector("#messageArea");
    messageArea.innerText = event.data;
  }
});
The player sends progress updates containing:
id: Content ID
type: Content type (movie/tv)
progress: Watch progress percentage
timestamp: Current playback position in seconds
duration: Total duration in seconds
season: Season number (for TV shows)
episode: Episode number (for TV shows)
Events Sent
timeupdate - Continuous progress during playback
play - When video starts
pause - When video pauses
ended - When video ends
seeked - When user seeks to different time

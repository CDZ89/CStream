Frequently asked questions
Everything you want to know.
Is it free? How do I join?
Yes, everything is free. You don't have to create account or api key. Just download our player and upload it to your website.

Are there any ads?
There is only popup ad from us to cover servers costs. Ad level on all video streaming servers is set to the lowest level possible (0% earnings and usually just 1 popup). If you see more than 1 popup or notifications/banners/videos before or while playing video - those are ads from video hosting servers and we can't control them. You can embed only our VIP player with just one popup ad or you can contact us if you have a website with big traffic and we'll lower the ads for you.

Does it work with Dooplay/Psyplay/Toroflix?
Yes, our player works with any template. We also offer integration files ready to download for Dooplay here.

What servers are available?
You can choose from premium servers with quality selector and subtitles or from the most popular videohosts, namely streamtape, doodstream, mixdrop, streamsb, voe, upstream, abyss, streamhide and more.

Do you have a demo player?

Installation Guide
Let's get started.
We offer two types of implementation. Easy way and advanced way. In order to make our player work on your website the advanced way you need a server with PHP and cURL or file_get_contents enabled. You download our player php file and upload it to your website. This file calls our server for a player url and then redirects to it.

Simple way
Just paste url to iframe. No extra files needed. Works on all servers, even Blogger.

Request movie by IMDB id: https://multiembed.mov/?video_id=tt8385148
Request movie by TMDB id: https://multiembed.mov/?video_id=522931&tmdb=1
Request episode by IMDB id: https://multiembed.mov/?video_id=tt13157618&s=1&e=2
Request episode by TMDB id: https://multiembed.mov/?video_id=114472&tmdb=1&s=1&e=2

Paste these urls to iframe and the player will appear there. Just change imdb or tmdb id.
For IMDB id you can use tt0000000 or just number 0000000.
For season and episode parameters you can use s=1&e=1 or season=1&episode=1.
Don't forget to always include &tmdb=1 if using TMDB id.

NEW! Request VIP player
With this method you can request only VIP player (multi quality, fast HLS streaming, subtitles) with just one popup ad. If the requested movie/episode is not available with VIP player our normal player will be used.

Request movie by IMDB id: https://multiembed.mov/directstream.php?video_id=tt6791350
Request movie by TMDB id: https://multiembed.mov/directstream.php?video_id=447365&tmdb=1
Request episode by IMDB id: https://multiembed.mov/directstream.php?video_id=tt13157618&s=1&e=2
Request episode by TMDB id: https://multiembed.mov/directstream.php?video_id=114472&tmdb=1&s=1&e=2

Paste these urls to iframe and the player will appear there. Just change imdb or tmdb id.
For IMDB id you can use tt0000000 or just number 0000000.
For season and episode parameters you can use s=1&e=1 or season=1&episode=1.
Don't forget to always include &tmdb=1 if using TMDB id.

You can Check if VIP player is available by adding &check=1. Returns 0 if not available and 1 if available.
Example: https://multiembed.mov/directstream.php?video_id=tt6791350&check=1

You can Add your own subtitles by adding &sub_url and &sub_label parameters. Your subtitles will appear first in list and autoplay. Must be urlencoded!
Example: https://multiembed.mov/directstream.php?video_id=tt6791350&sub_url=SUBTITLES_URL&sub_label=SUBTITLES_LABEL


Advanced way (recommended)

1. Download our player file.
Unzip it and upload it to the root of your website. You can rename the file or upload into subfolder but then you need to change the path and name accordingly in next steps.
